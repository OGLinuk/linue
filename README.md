# linue
Learning in New Unknown Environments. WEB601 assessment.

The assessment criteria was a 5-page website that implemented the MVC design pattern, a MySQL database backend, and a competition form which accepted various input and stored the information into the MySQL backend. We were to use the LAMP stack, but rather than PHP I decided to use Python.

* Home - Main page of linue that contains Roger's diffusion of innovation curve and the link to the competition form

* Blog - Page to contain the blogs I write during the creation of linue for my WEB601 class
