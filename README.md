Learning in New Unknown Environments. WEB601 assessment.

The assessment criteria was a 5-page website that implemented the MVC design pattern, a MySQL database backend, and a competition form
which accepted various input and stored the information into the MySQL backend. We were to use the LAMP stack, but rather than PHP I 
decided to use Python.
